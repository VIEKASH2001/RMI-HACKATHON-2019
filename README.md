This project was completed as a part of the inductions for the RMI Club, which is the Robotics research and development club of NITT. Our task was to design and build an elevator mechanism using a limited number of components.

In this repository, you will find all the necessary files and documentation related to our project. We have included the source code for the elevator mechanism, as well as detailed instructions for building and testing the mechanism. We have also included a report detailing our design process and the challenges we faced during the project.

We hope that our work on this project will serve as a useful reference for anyone interested in building their own elevator mechanism or learning more about robotics. Please feel free to explore our repository and contact us if you have any questions or comments.
